Note that for some code in the Week-11.ipynb file to run properly, you need download some files.

For MNIST, you need to follow the instructions and run mnist_jpg.py using the ubyte files to Week-11\mnist\ with subdirectories "training" and "testing."

For Dogs vs. Cats, you need to download the Dogs-vs-Cats dataset from Kaggle and unzip it to the Week-11/dogs-vs-cats directory.
